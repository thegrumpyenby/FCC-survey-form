# FreeCodeCamp — Certification Project #1
Survey form project created for FreeCodeCamp’s (New) Responsive Webdesign Bootcamp

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks
I decided to create a survey form that I might even be able to use down the road to build something more out of for my mental health awareness project [Taboola Rasa](https://www.taboolarasa.org). 

See [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form) for details on what’s required to pass the tests for this project
